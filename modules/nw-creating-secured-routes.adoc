= Creating secured edge terminated routes

You can create a secure edge terminated route where TLS termination occurs on
the ingress controller before the traffic is proxied to the destination. The
secure edge terminated route specifies the TLS certificate and key information.
The TLS certificate is served by the ingress controller front end.

.Procedure
. Create a private key for the edge secured route.
+
----
$ sudo openssl genrsa -out example-test.key 2048
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a
keyfile, use the following command:
----
$ sudo openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----
====

. Create a CSR for the edge secured route.
+
----
$ sudo openssl req -new -key example-test.key -out example-test.csr  \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Mountain View/O=OS3/OU=Eng/CN=www.example.test"
----

. Create a certificate for the edge secured route.
+
The procedure to create certificates is specific to your certificate
authority and provider.
The following command generates a simple self-signed certificate for a
domain named `www.example.test`.
+
----
$ sudo openssl x509 -req -days 366 -in example-test.csr  \
      -signkey example-test.key -out example-test.crt
----

. Generate a route using the certificate and key that you created.
+
----
$ oc create route edge --service=my-service \
    --hostname=www.example.test \
    --key=example-test.key --cert=example-test.crt
route "my-service" created
----

. View the route definition.
+
----
$ oc get route/my-service -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name:  my-service
spec:
  host: www.example.test
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

. Verify that the DNS entry for `www.example.test` points to the ingress
controller endpoint and that the route to your domain is available.
+
The example below uses curl and a local resolver to simulate the
DNS lookup:
+
----
$ routerip="4.1.1.1"  <1>
$ curl -k --resolve www.example.test:443:$routerip https://www.example.test/
----
<1> Replace the IP address with the IP address or addresses at which the ingress
controller endpoint is published.
